# The Five Phases of AI Leverage

## Why Most AI Roadmaps Are Upside Down

Most organizations approach AI strategy backwards. They start with the tool ("We need to implement GPT-4 for customer service") and work toward vague business outcomes. Or they start with a visible problem ("Our competitors are using AI for competitive intelligence") and jump straight to execution.

Both approaches produce the same result: expensive pilots that demonstrate technical feasibility but fail to transform anything meaningful. The AI works. The organization doesn't change.

The problem isn't the technology. It's the sequence.

AI roadmaps typically flow from solution to problem. Effective AI strategy flows in the opposite direction: from uncertainty to execution. The difference matters because AI creates leverage in a specific way. It doesn't just accelerate existing processes. It dissolves constraints that shaped those processes in the first place.

To capture that leverage, you need a framework that starts with the right questions.

## The Five Phases

### Phase 1: Map Risk and Uncertainty

Most strategic planning focuses on what we know. AI leverage lives in what we don't know.

The first phase identifies where performance potential is genuinely unclear. Not "we're uncertain about market conditions" (everyone is). But specific zones where the right answer isn't obvious, where reasonable people disagree, where the organization has avoided making choices because the information to make them well didn't exist.

These uncertainty zones are where AI creates the most leverage. Why? Because AI can explore multiple possibilities simultaneously at marginal cost. Humans exploring uncertainty face a brutal trade-off: every path investigated is a path not taken. AI dissolves that trade-off.

**Concrete example:** A financial services firm believes its underwriting models are well-optimized. They've been refined for decades. But when asked "where is your uncertainty about customer risk?" they reveal a different picture. They suspect their models miss significant segments. They've avoided investigating because each exploratory analysis costs analyst time that could go toward production work. The uncertainty zone isn't "our models might be wrong." It's "we've never been able to afford the exploration to find out."

Phase 1 makes these zones visible. Not every uncertainty is worth exploring. But you can't prioritize what you can't see.

### Phase 2: Trace Information Flows

Once you know where uncertainty lives, you need to understand how information moves. Phase 2 maps how data is generated, organized, stored, analyzed, and acted upon.

This isn't a technology audit. It's a search for human bottlenecks that automation can relieve.

In most organizations, skilled professionals spend enormous energy on information processing: gathering data from multiple sources, formatting reports, checking consistency, routing requests to the right people. This processing work crowds out judgment work. The person best qualified to interpret competitive dynamics is instead compiling the competitive analysis from seventeen different inputs.

AI leverage in Phase 2 isn't about replacing human judgment. It's about freeing humans for judgment by automating the processing that precedes it.

**Concrete example:** A consulting firm's partners spend 15 hours per week on business development. When traced carefully, only 3 of those hours involve actual relationship-building or strategic conversation. The other 12 hours: identifying prospects, researching their situations, drafting initial outreach, scheduling logistics. All of it is information processing that could be automated. The constraint isn't "we need AI to generate leads." It's "we need AI to stop partners from doing lead processing so they can do lead conversion."

Phase 2 reveals these constraints. It shows where information is getting stuck and why.

### Phase 3: Expand Aspiration

Phases 1 and 2 are analytical. Phase 3 is imaginative.

Most AI conversations start with efficiency: "AI helps us do X faster." This framing captures only a fraction of the value. The real question is: "What does AI let us do that we couldn't do before?"

Phase 3 helps leaders see new possibilities. Not incrementally better versions of current operations, but fundamentally different approaches that the economics of AI enable.

**Concrete example:** A manufacturing company wants AI to predict equipment failures (an efficiency play). Phase 3 questioning reveals a bigger opportunity. They've never offered customers predictive maintenance as a service because the monitoring would require too much analyst time per customer. AI changes that constraint. The opportunity isn't "predict our own failures better." It's "build a new revenue stream by predicting everyone's failures." Same data, different business model.

Phase 3 challenges the assumption that AI is about cost reduction. Often the leverage is in capability expansion.

### Phase 4: Refactor Problem-Solving

This is where the framework gets interesting.

Organizations have ingrained approaches to problem-solving shaped by historical constraints. When exploration was expensive, early commitment made sense. Lock in a direction, execute efficiently, accept that you might be wrong because the alternative (keeping options open) was even more expensive.

AI dissolves that constraint. Parallel exploration becomes cheap. Maintaining productive ambiguity while testing viability becomes possible.

Phase 4 identifies where artificial path dependence is limiting options. Where has the organization committed too early because the cost of keeping multiple paths alive was prohibitive? Where have "best practices" hardened into assumptions that no longer apply?

**Concrete example:** A product development team follows a stage-gate process designed to kill ideas early. The logic: exploring bad ideas is expensive, so filter ruthlessly. But with AI-assisted prototyping, exploring ideas is cheap. The filter that made sense when exploration cost $50,000 per concept doesn't make sense when it costs $500. The process isn't optimizing for current reality. It's optimizing for a constraint that no longer binds.

The explore/exploit balance shifts when exploration costs drop. Phase 4 helps organizations recognize and act on that shift. Premature commitment made sense in a world of scarce analytical capacity. Productive ambiguity makes sense in a world of abundant AI.

### Phase 5: Execute with Judgment

After mapping uncertainty, tracing information, expanding aspiration, and refactoring problem-solving, Phase 5 turns to action.

This is where most organizations want to start. And honestly? Starting here often makes sense, as long as you're prepared to be pulled back.

Execution in an AI-augmented world looks different from traditional execution. AI handles execution at scale: generating content, processing data, running analyses, managing routine decisions. Humans provide what AI cannot: experience, taste, the ability to reframe problems, judgment about when the rules should be broken.

The operating model is continuous supervision, not "set and forget." The human role shifts from doing to directing, from processing to evaluating, from executing to quality-controlling.

**Concrete example:** A marketing team uses AI to generate campaign variations. The AI can produce 100 versions in the time a copywriter produces 3. But the human isn't eliminated. The human reviews, selects, refines, and maintains brand judgment that the AI approximates but doesn't truly understand. The work changes from "write copy" to "direct and curate AI copy production."

Phase 5 is where value is delivered. But it's only sustainable when built on the foundation of Phases 1-4.

## The Pull-Back Pattern

Here's what actually happens in practice: nobody starts at Phase 1.

Most engagements begin at Phase 3, 4, or 5. "We want AI for competitive intelligence" (Phase 5). "We need to rethink our product development process" (Phase 4). "What new services could AI enable?" (Phase 3).

Starting with action isn't wrong. It's productive.

But action consistently reveals foundational questions. The competitive intelligence request triggers: "What decisions does this intelligence actually inform?" (Phase 3). That question triggers: "How does competitive information flow through our organization today?" (Phase 2). Which triggers: "Where is our real uncertainty about competition, and is intelligence the right response?" (Phase 1).

This recursive discovery is a feature, not a bug. You can't answer Phase 1 questions in the abstract. You need the concreteness of a Phase 5 request to make them real. The pull-back pattern uses action to reveal the questions worth asking.

Organizations that expect a linear Phase 1-through-5 progression get frustrated. Organizations that embrace the pull-back pattern move faster. They start acting, notice when they're stuck, trace the stuckness to a foundational gap, address the gap, and return to action with new clarity.

## What This Means for AI Strategy

If you're a leader approaching AI strategy, here's the practical implication:

**Start acting, but expect to be pulled back.** Don't wait for perfect foundational understanding. Launch a pilot, build a prototype, implement a tool. But when you encounter friction, resist the temptation to push harder. Trace the friction to its source. It's usually a Phase 1 or 2 question hiding behind a Phase 5 problem.

**Invest in mapping before scaling.** Phases 1 and 2 feel like overhead when you're eager to deploy. They're not. They're the difference between pilots that scale and pilots that stall. The mapping work identifies where AI will actually create leverage versus where it will create impressive demos that don't change the business.

**Challenge the efficiency frame.** "Faster" and "cheaper" are valid AI outcomes. But they're not the only outcomes, and often not the most valuable. Push toward Phase 3 thinking: what does AI make possible that wasn't possible before?

**Embrace productive ambiguity.** The instinct to commit early and execute efficiently is deep. It's also increasingly wrong. When exploration costs drop, the organizations that maintain optionality longer will outperform the organizations that lock in early. This requires different leadership behavior, different incentive structures, and different definitions of progress.

**Design for human judgment, not human replacement.** Phase 5 execution works when humans maintain meaningful roles: directing, evaluating, reframing. It fails when humans become rubber-stamps for AI output or when AI becomes a tool that skilled professionals resent. The goal is augmentation that makes human judgment more valuable, not automation that makes it irrelevant.

AI leverage isn't about the technology. It's about understanding where the technology creates new strategic possibility and reorganizing to capture it. The five phases provide a map. The pull-back pattern provides a method.

Start wherever you are. Expect to discover where you need to go.
